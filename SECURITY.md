# Security Policy
Wow, have you found a security vulnerability? You'll need to create an issue! Please read the notes below so your Issue can be noticed and reviewed by our dev team.

Security vulnerabilities are internally classed in 3 levels: Safe, Euclid, Keter (SCP Classes, becuase why not). This will determine the priority of your report. This should help you determine the estimated time to patch. If you want to patch it yourself, make sure you create a issue anyway to ensure it has been properly logged and reviewable in the future. (Statistics, Activity Reviews & Other Misc things.)

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please create a Issue with the [SECURITY] prefix. This helps us label your issue correctly and gives our team a quick way to find, review and patch said vulnerability. If your report is verified and patched, you'll be added to the 'AUTHORS.md' under the SECURITY REPORTERS section.

Please keep in mind, if your report is made from an unsupported version, it will wither be ignored if not severe or reviewed in the most updated version. This way, we know if your report has been patched between versions.
